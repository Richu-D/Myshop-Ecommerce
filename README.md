# Myshop-Ecommerce
I developed an e-commerce application utilizing technologies such as MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, JWT, and Razor Pay integration as the payment gateway. 
The application features image cropping, zooming, and a data table using jQuery. 
The admin side of the application has interfaces for product management, user management, category management, and coupon management. 
To ensure secure user authentication, the application uses OTP verification during the sign-up process, and Razor Pay as the payment gateway for transactions. 
I utilized the full potential of the technologies used to create a user-friendly and efficient e-commerce platform.
